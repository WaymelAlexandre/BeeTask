Bee Keeping

A console application needs to created to manage some beehives.  The application needs to be able to:

    Create beehives (with bees)
    From each beehive run the CollectHoney method for a specified number of days
    Report on the number of bees in each beehive

 

To start off create 2 beehives

        4 bees (John, Paul, George, Ringo) -> Sizes (3.2, 2.7, 1.1,  2.0)
        3 bees (Kurt, Dave, Krist) -> Sizes (2.3, 7.4, 1.5)

Create a class diagram before starting.
